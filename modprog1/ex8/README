a program that have 13 parts and the user need to choose between 13
option what he/she want to do
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, id = 305599417, login = michaelshr

the user need to:
part 1: put value to array
part 2: search value as he want
part 3: sorting the array in order small to big
part 4: search value as he want only if the array sorted in order small
to big via binary search algorithm
part 5: count how many times value show in the array
part 6: print the array from the beginning to the last
part 7: print the array from the last to the beginning
part 8: check if the array sort in up order
part 9: check if the array is palindrom
part 10: check how many values are the sum of the last tow
part 11: copy to another array the values are show one time in
the current array
part 12: check what value is prime number and print it
part 13: EXIT the program.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex8a.cc â€“oex8a
Run: ex8a
Input: 	array and user choices;
            e.g. 1
		 23 4 62 0 -4 2 -67 7 1 0
		 3
		 4
		 0
		 4
		 62
		 4
		 23
		 4
		 -67
		 6
		 7
		 8
		 10
		 11
		 12
		 13

Output: 

	    e.g. 1
		 1
		 1
		 1
		 -67 -4 0 0 1 2 4 7 23 62 
		 62 23 7 4 2 1 0 0 -4 -67 
		 1
		 0
		 -67 -4 1 2 4 7 23 62 
		 2 7 23 

Run Time for all: n^2, when n is the max size of the array

run time for one function any time:
part 1: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 2: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 3: n^2 , when n is the max size of the array
part 4: log n , when n is the max size of the array
part 5: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 6: 1
part 7: 1
part 8: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 9: 1
part 10: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 11: n , when n is the max size of the array
part 12: n*m , when n is the max size of the array
	 and m is the number to check if he prime

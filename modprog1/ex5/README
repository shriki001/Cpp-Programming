File:ex5a.cc
a program that found the max sum value rows and cols in an array
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

the program found the sum of max rows and max cols int an array and print
the location of the max rows and the max cols

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5a.cc –oex5a
Run: ex5a
Input: 	2nd array;
            e.g. 9 30 42 11 21
		34 22 13 21 11
		8 7 5 3 2  
		2 2 3 -9 1.

Output: the max rows and max cols of the array
	    e.g. 0 2 

Run Time: O(n^2) when we have a square matrix

===============================================================================

File:ex5b.cc
part one: a program that found the row that contain all of the rows
part two: a program that found the row that contain all of the rows
by the definition
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

part one: the program found the row that contain all of the rows
part two: the program found the row that contain all of the rows by the show
of the value in the other row

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5b.cc –oex5b
Run: ex5b
Input: 	2nd array;
            e.g. 1 1 4 5 17
		 3 3 1 1 5
		 1 3 4 5 17
		 1 4 5 3 17.

Output: the number of the rows that contain all the rows.
	e.g. 2
	     -1

Run Time: O(n^2) when we have a square matrix

File:ex5c.cc
a program that check how many slants are bigger the the previous corner
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

the program check if the next slants bigger then the previous corner

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5c.cc –oex5c
Run: ex5c
Input: 	2nd array;
            e.g. 8 12 14 20
		 9 15 21 30
		 12 16 40 1
 		 16 17 5 4
		 20 3 3 2.


Output: the program print the number of slats that bigger then the corner
	    e.g. 4

Run Time: O(n^2) when we have a square matrix

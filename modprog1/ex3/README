positive and negative
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

the program calculate the average and counting how many numbers are
positive and negative

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3a.cc –oex3a
Run: ex3a
Input: 	any numbers from the user until the user put 0
            e.g. 10 20 30 0.

Output: how much operand the user put , what is their
average , how many was positive and how many negative
	    e.g. 3 20 3 0.

a program that finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of tow numbers
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

this program finding the GCD of tow numbers via Euclid's algorithm

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3b.cc –oex3b
Run: ex3b
Input: pairs of numbers from the user until the user put 0
            e.g. 120 63 8 2 0.

Output: the GCD of all the pair numbers.
	e.g. 3
	     2

a program that ask from the user to guess a number from the random
numbers that the computer come up with
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

the program get form the user the max range of the random numbers from 0,
the program ask the user to guess the random number that the computer
come up with and for every step the program tell the user if his/her guess was
too big or too small, also the program give to the user info about how many
steps rational unlucky user would need to get the job down,
finally the program give to the user his grade.
after all this the program ask the user if he/she want to start all over

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3c.cc –oex3c
Run: ex3c
Input: 	the max range of the random numbers and the user guess 
and finally 1 to start over or any number to exit
            e.g. 30 15 7 13 9 11 10 2

Output: the program tell the user every step if the guess id too big or too
small from the number that the computer come up with, the program print:
1) user's steps. 2) rational unlucky user steps. 3) the grade
	    e.g. too big
		 too small
		 too big
		 too small
		 too big
		 6 5
		 83
		 again? 1:YES

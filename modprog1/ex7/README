part 1: print copy of the first array with only alphabet and upper case
part 2: print the first array after we remove the value that common
with the second array

Compile: g++ -Wall ex7a.cc –oex7a
Run: ex7a
Input: 	2 strings to  2 arrays;
            e.g. abcabc
		 a

Output: (1) copy of the first array
	(2) the first array after we remove the value that common
 	    with the second array

	    e.g. ABCABC
		 bcbc 

Run Time: n*m when n is the size of array A and m is the size of array B

File:ex7c.cc
a program that find the max sequence in array
=========================================
Writen by: Michael Shriki, login = michaelshr

the program find the max sequence of one array in another

Compile: g++ -Wall ex7c.cc –oex7c
Run: ex7c
Input: 	2 strings to  2 arrays;
            e.g. abcabcefrt
		 abce


Output: the program print the max sequence between tow arrays
	    e.g. a

Run Time: n*m when n is the size of array A and m is the size of array B
